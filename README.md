## Prerequisites

- AWS Account with Lambda and S3 access
- A Telegram Bot Token
- OpenAI API Key
- AWS CLI installed and configured
- Node.js >= 16.0.0 (for local development)

## Deployment

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a Lambda function in AWS Console:
   - Runtime: Node.js 16.x or later
   - Handler: index.handler
   - Memory: 256MB (recommended)
   - Timeout: 30 seconds

4. Configure environment variables in Lambda:
   - Using npm script:
     ```bash
     npm run set-env -- --function-name YOUR_FUNCTION_NAME --region your-region
     ```
   - Or manually in AWS Console:
     ```env
     TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token_here
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
     AWS_REGION=your_aws_region_here
     S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_s3_bucket_name_here
     SERPER_API_KEY=your_serper_api_key_here
     BRAVE_API_KEY=your_brave_api_key_here
     ```

5. Deploy the code:
   - Using npm script:
     ```bash
     npm run deploy -- --function-name YOUR_FUNCTION_NAME --region your-region
     ```
   - Or manually:
     ```bash
     bash deploy.sh --deploy --function-name YOUR_FUNCTION_NAME --region your-region
     ```

6. Set up Telegram Webhook:
   - Create an API Gateway trigger for your Lambda

3. Start the local development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
